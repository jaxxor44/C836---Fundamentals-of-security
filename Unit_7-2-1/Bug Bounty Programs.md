# Bug Bounty Programs
- Offered by organizations as a mechanism for accepting and rewarding individuals who submit bugs or vulnerabilities.
- Rewards can be as little as a thank you, or sticker to large rewards.
- Some companies run their bug bounty program through other services:
	- [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/)
	- [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)
	- [Synack](https://www.synack.com/)
- Cloud service providers are much more strict with their testing.
- Because of the close tolerances in resources, cloud providers rarely allow testing without strict approval or agreement.
