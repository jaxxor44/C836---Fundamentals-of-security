# Vulnerability Assessment
- a vulnerability assessment is part of a [[Penetration Testing|pen test]], not the other way around.
- a process that uses specially designed tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
	- [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/)
	- [Nessus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_(software))
- Using just one of these tools is never enough, because assessments are an ongoing and evolving process that requires creativity to find holes.
- The process to conduct a high level assessment:
	- [[Mapping and Discovery]]
	- [[Scanning]]
## vulnerability assessments in the cloud
- Cloud providers may limit/restrict/block sweeping scans inside their network.
- Some service providers allow scanning with certain conditions/restrictions, such as [[Scanning#Agented Scans|agented scans]].
- Communication with the service provider about what you are doing is critical. Scanning traffic is indistinguishable from attack traffic.
## vulnerability assessments in containers
- Because of the scaling nature of containers, individual scanning is tricky.
- Most container software providers have some method to provide scanning ability in  [[Scanning#Agented Scans|software]].
