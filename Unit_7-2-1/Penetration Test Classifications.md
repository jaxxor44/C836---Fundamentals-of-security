# Penetration Test Classifications
- testing with different levels of knowledge, starting places, or different teams.
- test classifications help designate what is in/out of bounds.
## Opacity
- Black box testing provides no knowledge of the environment to the tester other than the scope.
- white box testing gives the tester all the information about the environment available. Sometimes includes source code to websites and so on.
- gray box testing is a hybrid of the two systems. Some information is given, but not everything. This is the most common class of test.
## Internal vs External
- internal could mean a testing team is given access to inside the network, or a team that works for the company is conducting a test internally.
- external could be a 3ed party is tasked with working from outside.
