# Penetration Test targets
- denotes the specific area such as web applications, networks, or hardware.
## Network Pen test
- often the term used to describe overarching or general pen test.
- Usually not overly in depth because of time constraints (aka time boxed).
- Can include social engineering tests as well.
## Application Pen test
- focuses on applications, as the name suggests.
- demands specialized skills or tools.
- static testing, requires the tester to have the source for the app.
- dynamic testing is more realistic, the tester examines the app without inside knowledge.
## Physical Pen test
- picking locks, bypassing alarms or other covert entry.
- Its possible to enter, plant a device, and have persistent access.
## Social Engineering test
- does all the tests covered by [[Human Intelligence]], [[Phishing]] and [[Pretexting]].
- Almost always successful, so many organizations refuse them.
- People rarely ask about 'The IT guy' setting up a computer at an empty desk.
## Hardware test
- Often preformed on high security products, but can include TVs or IoT devices.
- Testing is conducted against the API used to communicate with servers, the device itself or other software.
- Hardware is tested especially when its equipped with UART or JTAG debug ports.
