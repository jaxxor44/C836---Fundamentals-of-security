# Mapping and Discovery
- Conducted against ranges or groups of potential targets.
- Ongoing mapping to check for changes over time.
- Most commonly scanned IP range is all class B addresses (includes 192.168.0.0)
- Its completely possible to overload routers or other network devices with aggressive discovery scans.
	- An alternative is *passive scanning* where you simply listen to the devices talking on the network and discover from that data.
- In a [[Vulnerability Assessment]] the next step is [[Scanning]].
