# Hash Functions
- sometimes called _keyless cryptography_.
- Not intended to make the message unreadable, but verify the message integrity.
- Creates a fingerprint of the message.
- Algorithms like _MD5_ and _SHA-1_ can compute a hash.
	- Most high security applications use _SHA-2_ or _SHA-3_.
- _Collisions_ are theoretically possible, but highly uncommon.
