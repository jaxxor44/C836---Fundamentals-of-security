# Malware
- software designed to produce unwanted results.
## Anti-malware tools
- most malware applications are subject to file signatures.
- Most anti-malware software typically updates at least once a day.
- Anti-malware software can be integrated into a [[Proxy Servers|proxy server]] to prevent propagation within the network. (via deletion of the email, striping the malware, or removing attachments)
## Executable Space Protection
- Prevents the operating system and applications from using certain portions of memory to execute code.
- This defeats the [[Software Development Vulnerabilities#Buffer Overflows|buffer overflow]] attack.
- Sometimes **address space layout randomization (ASLR)** is used to protect processing memory.
- Requires 2 components to function:
	- hardware component: Execute Disable (XD) bit (from intel) or Enhanced Virus Protection (AMD).
	- software components provided by the OS.
## Software firewalls and Host Intrusion Detection
- Same as large scale [[Firewalls]] and [[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]] systems, but with a much more confined scope.
