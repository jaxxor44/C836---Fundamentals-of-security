# The Operations Security Process
Identical to [[Risk Management cycle]].
![[Pasted image 20220802094330.png]]
## Identification of critical information
- first and most important step
- identify the assets that would cause you the most harm if exposed.
## Analysis of threats
- take the assets you have identified and analyze any threats to them.
- Identify who might exploit the exposure of valuable assets.
## Analysis of vulnerabilities
- look for vulnerabilities in the protections you have in place.
## Assessment of risks
- Threat x Vulnerability = Risk
- Decide what issues need to be addressed.
## Application of countermeasures
- Decide what [[Risk Response Categories|countermeasures]] and [[Risk mitigation, controls|controls]] to put in place for each Risk.
