# Attack Surface Analysis
- The greater the attack surface, the greater the [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Risk|risk]].
- One tool of [[Risk Management cycle#Assess risks|risk analysis and management]].

## Application Surface
- When analyzing for attack surfaces, commonly look at:
	- The amount of code
	- Data inputs
	- System Services
	- Network communication ports (OSI layer 7)

## Network Surface
- When analyzing for attack surfaces, commonly look at:
	- Overall network design
	- Placement of Mission critical servers & systems
	- Placement & configuration of network firewalls
	- Other security related devices: IDS, IPS, VPN, etc.

## User Surface
- When analyzing for attack surfaces, commonly look at:
	- Effectiveness of policies, procedures and training
	- Risk of social engineering
