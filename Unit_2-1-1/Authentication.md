# Authentication
- hardest to forge
- A one way process, unlike [[Mutual Authentication]].
- takes the verification information and checks against collaborating information.
- Authoritative, better than [[Identification]] and [[Verification]].
- Can be used to prove the identity of:
	- A user
	- A service/process
	- A workstation or server itself
	- A network device
- The subject of authentication falls into 3 categories:
	- People
	- Processes
	- Technology
