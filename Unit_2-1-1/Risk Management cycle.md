# Risk Management cycle
![[risk management process.png]]
## Identify Assets
- The most critical step
- the most complicated to do in large or complex organizations.

## Identify [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Threats|Threats]]
- you can use the frameworks of [[2.1 - What is Information Security#CAI Triad|CAI Triad]] or the [[2.1 - What is Information Security#Parkerian Hexad|Parkerian Hexad]] to document the threat modes.

## Assess [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Vulnerabilities|Vulnerabilities]]
- Be sure to do this within the context of a potential threat.
- Assess the potential [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Vulnerabilities|vulnerabilities]] with the highest possibility first

## Assess [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Risk|Risks]]
- Once a vulnerability is identified on a given asset, you can identify the overall risk.
- [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk#Risk|Risk]] in this context by the overlap of the 2 spheres of threat and vulnerability. 
- Use [[Quantitative Risk Analysis]] or [[Qualitative Risk Assessment]] to score and categorize risks.

## Mitigate risks
- If possible, prepare an [[Incident Response Process#Incident Response Process|incident response plan]].
- Put [[Risk mitigation, controls|controls]] in place, or take other [[Risk Response Categories|risk response]] steps.
