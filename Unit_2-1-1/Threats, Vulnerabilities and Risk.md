## Threats
- Something that has the potential to cause harm.
- Can be:
	- Natural
	- Unintentional
	- Intentional

## Vulnerabilities
- weakness or holes that threats can be exploited.
- Can be something specific like an operating system hole or unpatched upgrade.
- Can also include things like an old generator that may give out at some point.
- Prevent vulnerabilities with [[Risk mitigation, controls]].

## Risk
- The likelihood that something bad will happen
- requires both a threat and a vulnerability.
- Best to focus on the most likely attacks first.
- Make a plan for each type of risk according to its [[Risk Response Categories|risk response]]. 
- Different types:
	- Monetary
	- Reputation
	- Loss of Asset
	- Intellectual Property
	- Legal
- the different types of risk can be measured with a [[Qualitative Risk Assessment]] or a [[Quantitative Risk Analysis]].
