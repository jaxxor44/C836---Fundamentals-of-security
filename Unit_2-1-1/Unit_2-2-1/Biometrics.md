- A type of [[Factors#something you are|'something you are']] factor.

# Characteristics of Biometric Factors
- All biometric factors are defined by 7 characteristics:
- Universality
	- should find the characteristic in the majority of people you expect to enroll
- Uniqueness
- permanence
	- how well the characteristic resists change over time
- collectability
	- how easy is it to give/take the characteristic.
- Performance
	- how well a given system functions with speed, accuracy and error rate.
	- Biometrics performance is a calculation used to determine the threshold.
- Acceptability
	- how acceptable is this characteristic for the user base.
- Circumvention
	- how easy is it to trick the system?

# Biometrics Performance
- False Acceptance rate (FAR)
- False Rejection rate (FRR)
- Equal error rate (ERR)

- The balance point between FAR and FRR is the ERR.
