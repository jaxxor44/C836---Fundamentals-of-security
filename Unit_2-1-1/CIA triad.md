## Confidentiality
^03053f
- Our ability to protect data from those who are not authorized to view it. ^477c71
- This 1/3 of the CIA triad is a set of rules that limit access to data/information
- use [[Authentication]] to balance in favor of confidentiality

## Integrity
- The ability to prevent people from changing your data in an unauthorized or undesirable manner.
- This doesn't mean prevention, but the ability to undo/detect undesired changes when they happen.
- Integrity is maintained when data/information is both trustworthy and accurate.
- Data must not change in transit or be altered by unauthorized users.

## Availability
- The ability to access data when it's needed.
- Impacted by things from power outages to network attacks.
- Refers to the ability to provide reliable access to the data/information from authorized users.
- Rigorous hardware maintenance is the chief method of maintaining availability.
