## Least Privilege
- A user, system, process or application is only given the permissions necessary to complete its assigned task or functions and nothing else.
- Reduces the [[Attack Surface Analysis#User Surface|user attack surface]] by limiting access from breached accounts.

## Implicit Deny
- An Access Control List (ACL) rule that blocks all traffic that isn't explicitly allowed.
