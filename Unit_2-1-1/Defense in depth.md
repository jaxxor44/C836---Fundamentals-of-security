# Defense in depth (DiD)
![[Defense in depth.png]]
- DoD model for how security should be laid out to defend a system.
- The goal isn't to stop all attackers, but put enough layers in place to notice an intruder with enough time to prevent an incident.
- Reducing your [[Attack Surface Analysis|attack surface]] on every layer, increases DiD.
- Requiring [[Authentication]] at every level can increase DiD resiliency.
- [[Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risk|vulnerabilities]] need to be assed at every level of the DiD model.
- Using multiple types of [[Risk mitigation, controls#Controls|controls]] over multiple layers will strengthen the DiD model.

## Data
- To eliminate the treasure, use [[Data Retention#Data Retention|data retention]] best practices.

## Application

## Host

## Internal Network
- Implement [[Least Privilege Principle#Implicit Deny|implicit deny]].

## External network
