# Mobile device Deployment Models
- Different ways a company can deploy end point devices to its users
## Bring your own device (BYOD)
- regulates the use of personal and corporate devices in the workplace.
- This model has a lot of grey area between what is personal and what is corporate.
## Corporate owned business only (COBO)
- deployed for business only
- for highly secure, mobile business
## Corporate owned personally enabled (COPE)
- Allows for a business device to be used for some personal functions.
- less restrictive.
