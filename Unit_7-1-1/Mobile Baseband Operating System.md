# Mobile Baseband Operating System
- a low level firmware/ software OS that interfaces with the radios, USBs, and GPS system.
- Short of an update from the manufacturer, there is little you can do about this.
- An example is *Signaling System No.7* aka *SS7*.
- You can mitigate some of these major flaws by enabling additional encryption, or application segmentation.
