# Protecting People
- Equipment can be replaced, but people are hard to train and replace in a reasonable time.
- enacting [[Physical Security Controls]] can include protection for the people in those spaces.
- Protecting your people also means having contingency plans in place for emergencies, as outlined in the [[Risk Management cycle]].
- Data centers sometimes use dangerous chemicals to extinguish fires, the result is areas that may have safety overrides to prevent personnel from harm while a fire is extinguished.
- Practicing emergency procedures can expose vulnerabilities in the emergency response process. AKA [[Risk Management cycle#Assess Threats Vulnerabilities and Risk Vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities|Assess Vulnerabilities]].
